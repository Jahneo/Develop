# code was added to make the web site load asynchronously all images at once
this link <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'"> was added to make the sit load faster

#  Several trial and errors with code to trim and combine several codes using .class
Making the codes shorter and more meaningful

# Issues 
site doesn't load properly on cell phones and when site is minimized from the sides text becomes illegible

# Positives
Links are functional 
Site loads without errors 
Site is published on Git Hub
